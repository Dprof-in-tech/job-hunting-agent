# 🚀 Multi-Agent Job Hunting System

An intelligent, collaborative AI system that employs multiple specialized agents to provide comprehensive job hunting assistance. Each agent is an expert in their domain, working together to deliver superior results.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### **Multi-Agent Design Philosophy**

Instead of a single agent with multiple tools, this system uses **specialized agents** that collaborate:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Coordinator   │────│ Resume Analyst  │────│ Job Researcher  │
│   (Orchestrator)│    │   (Expert)      │    │    (Expert)     │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                 │
         ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
         │   CV Creator    │────│  Job Matcher    │
         │   (Expert)      │    │   (Expert)      │
         └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Basic Multi-Agent Usage**
```python
from multi_agent_system import JobHuntingMultiAgent

# Initialize the system
system = JobHuntingMultiAgent()

# Process different types of requests
result = system.process_request(
    user_message="I need complete job hunting help",
    resume_path="my_resume.pdf"
)

# Check which agents were involved
print(system.get_agent_status(result))
```

### **Scenario-Based Examples**

#### **1. Complete Job Hunt (All Agents)**
```python
request = "I need comprehensive help with my job search. Please analyze my resume, research the market, find opportunities, and create an optimized CV."
resume = "resume.pdf"

# Expected flow: Coordinator → Resume Analyst → Job Researcher → CV Creator
result = system.process_request(request, resume)
```

#### **2. Resume Analysis Only (Single Agent)**
```python
request = "Can you analyze my resume and tell me what needs improvement?"
resume = "resume.pdf"

# Expected flow: Coordinator → Resume Analyst
result = system.process_request(request, resume)
```

#### **3. Job Market Research (Focused Analysis)**
```python
request = "What's the current job market like for data scientists? I want to understand trends and demand."

# Expected flow: Coordinator → Job Researcher  
result = system.process_request(request)
```

#### **4. Job Application Strategy (Multiple Agents)**
```python
request = "I found some jobs I'm interested in. Help me understand which ones fit my background best."
resume = "resume.pdf"

# Expected flow: Coordinator → Resume Analyst → Job Researcher → Job Matcher
result = system.process_request(request, resume)
```

## 🔄 Agent Collaboration Patterns

### **Sequential Collaboration**
```
Resume Analyst → Job Researcher → CV Creator
     ↓               ↓              ↓
Analysis Results → Market Data → Optimized CV
```

### **Parallel Processing** 
```
                Coordinator
                     ↓
        ┌────────────┼────────────┐
        ↓            ↓            ↓
Resume Analyst  Job Researcher  Job Matcher
        ↓            ↓            ↓
    Results consolidation in CV Creator
```

### **Data Sharing Examples**
- **Resume Analyst** identifies target roles → **Job Researcher** searches for those specific roles
- **Job Researcher** finds in-demand keywords → **CV Creator** incorporates them into the CV
- **Resume Analyst** identifies strengths/weaknesses → **Job Matcher** uses this for fit analysis
